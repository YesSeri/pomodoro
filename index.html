<!-- We are going to make a Pomodoro clock similar to this which will count down twenty-five minutes of work, indicate it is break time, count down five minutes, then start over again. If youâ€™ve been following along the curriculum, you should have most of the tools you will need to make it. But if you do have problems, there are two of you! Put your minds together and figure it out. -->
